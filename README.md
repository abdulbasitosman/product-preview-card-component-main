## My process

I started by setting up the project where I put all my images in a folder
`/images`. After setting the project up, I started designing for `Desktops`. This make it easy write for `Mobiles` as the the layouts didn't differ from each other that much.

I started with the markup - `HTML5` wrapping all elements in the `main` element with a class of `.product-card` which I used for styling. Contents in the `<main>` are also group into two sections using the `section` element with classes `.product-card__left`, `.product-card__right` respectively for first section and second section.

`.product-card__left` has no other element but it's that will contain our images. That will be done use `CSS3`. `.product-card__right` will contain the text elements with classes for use in the stylesheet.

Pure `CSS3` was used for styling using topdown approach.
